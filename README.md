# MuseFlow

##Abstract
Mind-wandering, i.e., letting the mind drift away from the
task at hand, is mostly seen as a state of mind to avoid, as it may
negatively impact the current task. However, evidence in cognitive sci-
ence shows that mind-wandering can also positively affect creativity and
problem-solving. Still, there is a lack of technological solutions to facil-
itate and utilize mind-wandering in such a specific way. In this short
paper, we present MuseFlow, a video game designed to facilitate mind-
wandering deliberately. Our study shows that MuseFlow induces mind-
wandering significantly more often compared to a demanding game con-
dition while maintaining the players' motivation to play and succeed in
the game.
